For example, on a web forum, admins have the permission to delete posts and ban users, while normal users do not. The process of granting and checking these permissions is authorization. Not to be confused with the related process of authentication."
AWS,"Amazon Web Services. A web hosting service offered by Amazon that provides a number of different cloud-based software products. AWS allows customers to rent time on their servers to host their own web servers, databases, CDNs, etc. Using AWS saves time and money compared to buying a dedicated server, as customers can pay by-the-minute for the resources they need and can leave maintenance in the hands of AWS."

C#,
cache,
CDN,"Content Delivery Network. CDNs are used to temporarily store content like webpages, images, and video files in various locations in order to improve performance and reduce cost. For example, if you rent a server in Northern California to store images, it will take a comparitively long time for these images to reach users in other parts of the world. CDNs will store copies of these images in various other locations around the world. So, a user in London might access the images from a server 50 miles away rather than one 5000 miles away."

GitHub,"GitHub is a company that provides hosting for code, allowing for developers to track changes and collaborate. All of the code hosted on Github uses the Git version control system."
Go/Golang,"Go is a high-performance programming language developed at Google. Go programs are incredibly fast and web applications written in Go vastly outperform those written in alternatives like Ruby on Rails. The trade-off is that writing good software in Go is much more difficult than many of the alternatives. It is much harder to find developers to work in Go, and they are much more expensive. Go software may also take a much longer time to build, and is therefore only recommended for types of software where performance is a major concern."
Heroku,"Heroku is a ""Platform as a Service"" that simplifies the process of using AWS for hosting web applications. It is more expensive than using AWS alone, but reduces the time required to deploy and update software. In many cases it reduces the need to employ a SysAdmin for managing AWS infrastructure, so the added cost is often a worthwhile trade-off."
hosting,A hosting service allows companies to make their websites and software available over the internet.

HTTP,"HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP can be thought of as the language of the web, and allows different computers to talk with one another and exchange information over the internet. The most common form of information that is exchanged using HTTP are HTML webpages, which gives the protocol its name."
HTTPS,Uses SSL along with HTTP to encrypt communication over the internet. 
hybrid app,"Hybrids apps are web frontends that use JavaScript and HTML, embedded into a native mobile app. Hybrid apps allow frontend web developers to create native mobile apps for both Android and iOS at the same time without much knowledge of the programming languages specific to those platforms. This saves time and eliminates the need for a separate mobile developer. The tradeoff is that hybrid apps do not match the performance of native mobile apps, but in many cases the differences are not noticeable to users. Common examples are React Native, Ionic and Xamarin."
I/O,
Ionic,
iOS,
Jade,
Java,"Java is a programming language with many applications, but most commonly associated with the backend of web applications and Android applications. Java was very popular in the 90s and 00s for the web, but has fallen out of favor recently. Not to be confused with JavaScript, an entirely different programming language."
JavaScript,"JavaScript is the most widely-used programming language in the world, due to the fact that it is the only language supported by all of the major web browsers. JavaScript provides interactivity to web pages, and is the only common frontend language. JavaScript can also be used as a backend language with Node.js."
jQuery,
library,
Linux,"Linux is an open-source operating system. Linux is free to use, and is maintained and updated by a group of volunteer developers around the world. Linux can be used on Desktop PCs, but is only popular for this amongst knowedeable computer experts and enthusiasts. While Linux only has a niche application for desktops, it is the most popular operating system for servers, with one estimate stating that over 70% of server on the internet use a Linux operating system."

NoSQL,A type of database that is an alternative to relational databases. NoSQL databases do not use SQL to interact with data (hence the name). NoSQL databases are popular for types of data that have unkown or variable structure. NoSQL databases have other differences and trade-offs when compared to traditional relational databases as well.
NPM,
Objective-C,
open source,"Software that is built using code that is publicly visible and accesible. The prototypical example is Linux, an operating system that is free to use and modify. Linux is maintained by a distributed group of volunteer developers around the world. In contrast, Apple Mac OSX is closed source. The code is not publicly visible, and only paying customers who own Mac computers can use it. OSX is also only written and maintained by developers who work at Apple."
operating system,
payment gateway,"A service that simplifies the process of accepting payments by credit card, bank transfer, paypal and other systems. Developers and companies pay a small transaction fee to payment gateway providers in exchange for ease of setup, and to leverage the security and reliability of the provider.

Ruby on Rails,"A web application framework created to allow developers to build the backend of common web applications quickly and efficiently. Rails is built using the Ruby programming language, and provides a scaffolding for developers to write code on top of. This solid foundation allows for fast development and reduces the number of bugs that arise."
Sass,
Scala,"A modern, high-performance language based on Java. Scala is very popular for software with huge traffic or performance demands, but is not recommended for smaller software projects because developers can be hard to find and are expensive.
